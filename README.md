# Portfolio Website

Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, it showcases my projects, certifications, and provides an easy way to get in touch.

The portfolio highlights some of my work in AI and machine learning, alongside web and mobile applications.  
It features a clean, modern design with smooth animations, a dedicated section for certifications, a resume download option, and a contact form that sends messages directly to my email.
